## ✨ Features ✨

    -   You can add a description to the pack and also name it
    -   **Mod: needs version 1.1.0 or higher for ingame support**
-   Bulk update blueprints
    -   If you are the author of a blueprint, you can update them in bulk update by using the new button in the "My blueprints" list.
    -   Only the blueprints that have a file with the same name as the uploaded one will be updated.
